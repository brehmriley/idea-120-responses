I read about nine pages of this article besides the two or three pages that talk about the Manovich saying and I thought it was rather absurd. I thought a lot of points Nakamura made were silly and littered with high level language that wasn’t needed and were only there to make her points seem more scholarly. I thought her breakdown of Jenifer Lopez’s music video was very inaccurate and reaching to say the least. When she called the male in the video white when he was objectively racially ambiguous I thought most of her points on race went out the window. After that I then personally had to stop reading. That is besides the point of the writing prompt. I thought Nakamura’s citation of Manovich was by far the most thought provoking argument she brought up.

I think there are logical inferences that UI designers use to best fit the general population. I think the mental structure of the developer only goes so far as Instagram is one of the most personal and rapidly changing homepages out there. I might be biased as I only use Instagram but I sure use it a lot. In my years of using Instagram and all the days and probably weeks I have put into it I have noticed how the algorithm has changed and how it has been personalized for me. Based on when I log on to instagram I will get a different genre of pictures on my timeline. It will range from snowboarding videos to fashion to my friends accounts to then the famous accounts I follow to then skateboarding videos and then so on and so forth. If I continue to like a certain theme I will continue getting shown more of that content. This is where I see the mental structure of me being put into a website that is being used by the masses. To try and relate this back to the developers mental structure I think they utilize the UI to be as broad and intuitive as possible. This comes from the way we have been accustomed to using our phones and where we are able to reach on our phone screens with one hand as we mostly browse our phones with one hand. I can’t say for sure as I didn’t design the UI of instagram or handle the updates but I think they moved the notification tab for a very specific reason. Putting it in the top right next to your DM’s is a much farther reach and I personally find myself clicking it a lot less than I did when it was in the bottom menu. I think they did this for two reasons. First reason was to replace its original position with a new part of instagram the shopping part of the app. As everyone was accustomed to clicking there to see who liked their post they instinctively reached there even after the new update came out to try and see your likes but you inevitably went to the shopping tab instead. You were then forced to see the new feature the heads at instagram made which I thought was rather ingenious. The second reason was in reaction to the mental health outcry that likes and seeing who is interacting with your posts causes people to have mental health issues. I say mental health issues but that isn’t the correct word. I know I would always check and it would give me a sort of anxiety about who liked my most recent, is my post doing well, is it getting enough likes. But after it was moved I seem to click it less. The button isn’t as big, the red tab that pops up that shows someone new liked my post isn’t as prominent as it was beforehand as it blends nicer with the DM notification. The serotonin boost I get from a new like isn’t as great as it was beforehand and I don’t know if that was intentional or a faulty design. I nonetheless enjoy it a lot more.
