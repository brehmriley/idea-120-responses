In this current state of the world where life is now more digital than ever along with the general progress of technology we have the opportunity to create things that no other generation could have thought possible. We can mix mediums like no other creatives could. Being able to seamlessly mix this digital world and real life without losing the humanness in it all is something we should all look forward to.
My ideas for making a Gesamtkunstwerk comes from seeing some of the greatest shows that we as humans put on. Such as the olympic opening ceremonies more specifically the London opening ceremony. The London opening ceremony utilized screens in the audience that made beautiful choreographed lights patterns that connected the audience and the performers. Using this idea of interconnectedness between viewer and performer through light is something that I want to have in my Gesamtkunstwerk. In making this work I feel it is appropriate to have it be centered around the current social climate we are in, the pandemic. Making a show that utilizes light, visuals, live music, choreographed movements while being in the theater itself or from the comfort of your home is something that is needed. 
My concept for a Gesamtkunstwerk would be a live event that can be attended physically or virtually. The physical aspect would take place in a social distanced concept theater where people would be separated in pods in the shape of a theater in the round. It would be a massively high theater with multiple stages think of the senate in Starwars. Where each separate stage would be a story with live music and actors these pods would move from stage to stage. While this is happening in a physical space the virtual space would be more cinematic compared to being in a theater. The virtual show would encourage users to have VR goggles but not required.
