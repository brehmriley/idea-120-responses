I believe Murrays assessment for the want of the die hard fan to be more immersed into the story is correct and that there is a market for that. I think the one aspect that is overlooked in his writing is the ability to make quality storylines that will be equivalent to the main story line. A few years ago a choose your own adventure movie was released on Netflix called Bandersnatch. I personally couldn’t get through the whole thing because I got bored and not invested in the plot. Everytime you would choose the wrong path you would have to start over which fatigued me as a viewer along with having to switch on and off with my roommate for picking what we should do. The idea of this was still attractive to me and Murray talked about the aspect of it that still stood out to me. The part where it was for the diehard fan compared to the casual. If there was this choose your own adventure for a show that I had already been emotionally invested in I might be more willing to want to learn all the side plots or small details that would be brought to light by making my own decisions. The idea that Murrary talked about about how this immersive experience will look in the long term is very similar to the story of Westworld on HBO. In Westworld it is a fixed story but the story is about an experience where you are able to go into this world and live your true fantasy. Where you are in the real world surrounded by robots and other guests in the experience but as a guest you don’t necessarily know who real or a robot. Just like he was talking about blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. The show highlights the shortcomings that are bound to happen in a “fully controlled” world while also showing the power that AI’s will undoubtedly have in the future. 
The hyper realistic sets on the Mandalorian for sure have the greatest impact on the actor in the short term. Being able to not imagine where you are or where something might be located in the foreground adds a more realistic environment for the actor. Murray talked about VR and the ability to move in three dimensional space but I don’t think he ever thought of the ability to make a set with depth in light form. From a viewer perspective the mandalorian looks great from the clips in the video. The vivid atmosphere the Mandalorian uses is perfect for LED light. A hope I have for the future of this technology is seeing the clips of the motorcycle ad. Seeing a real landscape portrayed on the LED backdrop that looked stunning and super realistic. Something that I didn’t fully appreciate the first time I watched the video. I hope to see more of this in the future.
