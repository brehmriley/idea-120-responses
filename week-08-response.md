Chalabi and O’Neil talked a lot about how information can be construed to form a narrative that is fitting for a company or organization. Chalabi talked about the misinformation within stats and how easy it is for an organization to unintentionally or intentionally misuse data to reflect it in a positive way. The points I found to be the most hard hitting from her talk was organizations using a small data pool and using averages to make data seem to be more substantial than it really is. O’Neil talked again about WMD and its impact on persuading lower income adolescents to go to for profit colleges. He talks about the predatory model of business that for profit colleges and loan agencies use to take advantage of the less fortunate customer. 

The internet would a hundred percent be more egalitarian without these predatory practices that for profit colleges use. I personally believe that these practices are morally wrong but putting a stop to them simply because they are wrong isn’t enough in America. They have a business model that is shiesty but it works and they should continue to do it just like the snake oil dealer of yesteryear did. These are slightly different as the snake oil dealer was selling straight lies that are now obviously false but from my knowledge I have always known that DeVry and University of Phoenix were always bad options. Just like I know astrology and tarot cards are not science, and that I shouldn’t waste my money in those practices if I want the genuine truth. My point of view comes from having the privilege of not being subjected to these businesses as truth or genuine something that I was taught. I believe that educating students early on in the highschool years of these fraudulent colleges is the best course of action in stopping them. I also believe that the government has to stop giving funding to these colleges that are not actively helping the economy by producing workers who will be active in the workforce. Which leads into another debate about government funding for colleges and who deserves it and how much should be given to colleges in the first place. Moving on to the targeted ads in this problem. I believe it is a very tricky scenario but it does need more regulation. I say I want more regulation but the type of regulation I want isn’t clear. I personally get creeped out when ads are targeted to me based on my conversations with friends and family. My phone being able to listen when I am not directly interacting with it is frightening and eye opening. However if I get a targeted ad based on my following list on instagram or the websites I frequent it feels less invasive. I think being able to balance the invasiveness of my phone hearing my private conversations not intended for anyone besides my friends compared to my public browsing that takes place on my phone which I have been acclimated to knowing is never private should be where the ads come from.
