What can we do with games that we can’t do with other mediums?

“And thats what games are good at: Exploring dynamics, relationships, and systems” 
Does this mean life is a game? Because I tend to look at some aspects of life as a game but I think that also can be a slippery slope.

Is getting stuck in traffic a game?

Only three paragraphs into chapter three and I found a talking point that I bring up a lot with friends. Traffic is one of the most underrated things about the city. Before I get into why I love traffic so much let me say one counterargument. If you have somewhere to be and there's more traffic than usual that can be annoying and frustrating but surrendering yourself to the city is something that I think is important in driving and in living in the city. 

So what is traffic in my mind. Being stuck in traffic and I’m going to use one highway as an example, the Kennedy. This interstate/ highway whatever you want to call it is the built environment in the city it is what physically makes the city the city. The interactions between humans and the built environment has always made the city so fascinating to me. This semester alone I spent almost 24 hours shooting the L train and everything that goes along with it because I am so attracted to the way humans interact with this built environment and their city. This is very similar to my relationship with the Kennedy and traffic itself. 

The most ideal traffic scenario for me is merging from I94 onto the Kennedy and seeing traffic in the distance. From this point I can see the skyline in almost any weather conditions which always helps me see the final goal of being .75 of a mile from the sears tower which is where my home is located in Little Italy. This scenario almost never happened in the last year not because I haven’t driven into the city but because of Covid restrictions have limited the amount people wanted to travel. Last year to the day I was driving into the city at about 9 oclock at night. There was no traffic, there was no one to be seen anywhere, I could go as fast as I wanted and I loved it. But that journey was a relationship between me and my car which I also could talk about for a while. I do not complain about those drives as they were different and I always made great time which turned into a game in and of itself (< 58mins from Racine WI to Little Italy) probably not the safest game but it was played nonetheless. But Covid restrictions were lifted and traffic started coming back and I had no need to leave at 9 oclock every weekend. I could drive in whenever and I always chose to come around afternoon rush hour. 

In the last 6 months the interstates have been congested again and you should be taking traffic into account if you do not want to hit any. Well if this isn’t obvious by now I want to hit some. Few weeks ago I drove into the city and I couldn’t have asked for better conditions. It was a clear blue skyed day as the sun was setting and I was stuck in traffic. I was in the second to farthest left lane. I could see the L train on my left passing by every 4-6 mins. I could see all the people on the platforms waiting patiently just like me and the car behind me was. We all were waiting, we all were powerless. In this scenario we could either rage at the traffic or surrender to what the city has dealt us. I definitely didn’t rage after all this is what I wanted. I was staring out the window looking at the lane to my right which happened to be going faster which I always think is peculiar as the left lane should be for passing but we all know thats never the case. I probably was contemplating merging lanes and testing my luck in that lane over mine. But I always decide to stay as I trust the left lanes always work better maybe not in the short term but definitely in the long run. Being in traffic for 20 mins you start to notice the cars that were once ahead of you who passed you on the right lane have now taken a backseat behind you. That gives me enjoyment. They tried to play traffic in the wrong way by forcing yourself through but I’ve come to find in standstill traffic your best bet is to wait it out in one lane. As I’m sitting in the car listening to my playlist and catching the best vibes I’m slowly being integrated back into the city from once I came. I never got this luxury during covid. I can stare at the Sears tower, the St Regis who just changed the skyline or any of the new skyscrapers going up. I can see the progress of the city from the last time I came. It's confronting that it's continuing to change. I also get the opportunity to stare at these buildings from a perspective I normally never can. I’m below the street level and it makes these already massive towers look even larger.  One of the best parts of traffic is the people watching. Seeing people in their cars talking on the phone, talking to a loved one, or simply just staring forward and succumbing to what is in front of them. I love this. Especially in the time of covid I can’t people watch like I used to. This helps fulfill the gap that Covid brought to this city and all other cities. 

I kinda already mentioned this but the interaction between the builte environment and humans of the city is so good. Knowing that when i look to my left or right we all have somewhere to go and the path we have to get there is the same. This in itself links us all in traffic which in turn links us to the city as we are on the roads built for this city. This is such a good feeling to feel when I have been stuck in Wisconsin and been dreaming of the “hustle and bustle” of the city once again and to be thrown directly into it is perfect. 

Another side note to this is I do have goals when I come into the city and sometimes I run late. I normally am always meeting up with a significant other or going to a function they both tend to be very exciting for me. And being stuck in traffic lets me play with that thought of being in the city with those people, it makes me feel small, it makes me enjoy the moments that are unique to me. Traffic lets tension build and when you finally get “home” that tension is released.

Either way traffic is absolutely an experience and a game for me which the rules are made by the city.
