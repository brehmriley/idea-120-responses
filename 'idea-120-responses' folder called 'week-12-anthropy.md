First off I enjoyed the paper by Ana Anthropy. I thought she made some really good points and it was laid out very well. She talked about the current culture of videogames. The culture that is dominated by major video game publishers whos main intention is selling copies. This creates games that all look the same and behave in the same monotonous way with very similar themes. A good quote from her that I think sums up this is “Publishers will do the minimal amount it can get away with in order to differentiate its game from all other games that follow its previously established model and that are being sold to its previously established audience  She blames the culture of the people who get into video games- the people who have a high knowledge in coding. The people that have this great knowledge in this field generally tend to look the same and come from a very similar background which in turn creates games that behave the same way. What she wants from video games is a plurality of voices and this model that is set up currently doesn’t allow for that. 

Her call for more people to make videogames is a hard one and she acknowledges that by talking more about just how hard it is to talk to a computer. I think her talking about the app store later on in the paper is one that is super interesting. The amount of games that we as consumers have access to has risen substantially and the motifs in these games are new and don’t follow the common plots of major video games being played on consoles. 

She also points out the shortcomings of the app store as any game created for iPhones still has to be approved by Apple which in turn limits the amount of games we truly can play. She wants a more creative video game world, one that has low levels of entry. She gives the examples of online programs that help the average joe make a videogame but as she said they still are not where they need to be to let anyone who wants to make a video game make one. This in my opinion just comes down to the medium of video games itself. A medium that is very complex and requires a lot of thought and knowledge to create something that is good. The non linear games you assigned us to look at reminds me of videogames and seems like a good way to utilize the medium of video games in decision making.

The game creation part of the prompt seems to hint at creating our own rules for set games. Such as when I was younger and played four square we would make up our own rules and eventually we strayed far enough away from foursquare to where we had to re name it and the game felt more like ours. Also I think of chess and the Fischer random or chess960 game that was created by objectively one of the best chess players ever.
