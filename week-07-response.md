Bridle's opinion on the future of the internet is a hard one to disagree with. He cares about the content children are digesting and some of that content is very inappropriate and sometimes grotesque. He points out that a lot of this is to blame from algorithms and not being able to monitor every single video that is uploaded to the internet. It reminds me of the WMD from last week and the inherent shortcomings of search engine optimization. The content that is being made for these children are very easy to produce and copy so the market is flooded with countless videos, some safe and others not so much. 
My personal opinion on this is in agreement with Bridle. He did write the article before YouTube started cracking down all the inappropriate videos. I'm not sure if he was the first one to break this story but I think it is safe to assume he was one of the first. His points on free speech are an interesting one. The thought if you post something to twitter YouTube or some other social site that you should be protected under free speech is a silly one. These platforms are owned and run by companies who have their own motives and agendas that you unintentionally sign up for once you make an account and decide to post. With that being said it is hard for these platforms to monitor all the content that is being shared especially in digital visual forms where algorithms aren’t as efficient. But adjusting to the times is needed and I think YouTube did that. Another problem with this is where the line is. I think everyone agrees adolescent children should not be subjected to gruesome things shown by their favorite characters. But once it comes to adult creators making videos for adults should they be punished as well by getting their ad revenue blocked or shadow banned. I personally don’t believe so. I think if any child were to stumble across those videos that would be unfortunate but I think some blame also has to be placed on the parents in this situation. Once you as a parent are aware of these problems on YouTube you have to handle it accordingly in any way you see fit.
