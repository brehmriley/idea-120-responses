In weapons of math destruction the author Cathy O’Neil talks about harmful computer algorithms. These algorithms were created by statisticians who had good intentions of creating programs to help solve problems. O’Neil points out the shortcomings of these algorithms. She highlights this with the story of Sarah Wysocki. Mrs Wysocki was a public school teacher in a failing school district. The heads of the school district wanted to get rid of underperforming teachers so they hired a company to help highlight the teachers who were underperforming. The methods for determining which teachers were underperforming were kept hidden. This created an atmosphere where teachers had no clue if they were doing good or not because they didn’t know the criteria on which they were being judged. Eventually teachers started to figure out that the WMD was taking the standardized tests into account for judging each teacher. This created an incentive for teachers to cheat the system by falsifying students' tests to make it appear as they did better than what they did. This translates into the problem with Mrs Wysocki. Wysocki was a well liked teacher by students, faculty and parents so she was very surprised when she found out that she was going to be let go. The teacher who taught her students before her was one of the teachers falsifying tests making it appear the students were smarter than they were. So when Wysockis students eventually graduated from her class they sometimes dipped in scores which made it appear that she made these kids less intelligent. This obviously wasn’t the case but the WMD didn’t account for people cheating the system. This input model wasn’t made perfectly but the leaders of the school district treated it as such which resulted in people losing jobs they were qualified for and which in turn kept bad teachers on the payroll.
